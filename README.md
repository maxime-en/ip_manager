# ip_manager

ip_manager is a REST API tool for hosts addresses, subnets and prefixes attribution in a local network. It allows you to create, delete, and list hosts and subnets, and assign them to devices.

The goal is to automate ip address and subnet attribution and to keep a unique database containing the status of address and subnet assignments.
